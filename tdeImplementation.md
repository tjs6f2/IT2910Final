#### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) Implementation

1. In order to start this process you need to create the master key in the master database.

2. Once you have created the master key, you will need to create the certificate
![create cert](https://github.com/tjs6f2/IT2910Final/blob/master/TDE%20Screenshots/create%20cert.PNG)

***

3. Next we need to create a connection between the certificate and the database we want to encrypt 
![create connection](https://github.com/tjs6f2/IT2910Final/blob/master/TDE%20Screenshots/create%20db%20key.PNG)

***

4. Then we want to enable the connection to encrpyt the database
